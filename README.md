Remixed version of Raspberry Pi Zero W version: https://github.com/jonbenfri/bathroom-monitor

# Description

Live monitoring a bathroom door's open or shut status.

# Overview

A node.js server (e.g. Raspberry Pi) connects clients using websockets (socket.io).

A WeMos D1 mini (ESP8266 board) has a magnetic reed switch soldered to its pins.

When the bathroom door is opened or closed, an ESP8266 interrupt is triggered, sending the door status via websockets to the nodejs server.

The nodejs server emits a signal to all connected clients informing of the new door status (open or cosed).

When users browse to node.js server (e.g. localhost:8080), door status is polled and displayed on a web page.

When door status changes, door status is sent via websockets to all connected clients. Web pages are updated.
